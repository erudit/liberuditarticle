The legacy of Canada's original means-tested pension program, the class politics of pension bargaining between business and organized labour on both sides of the border, the policy example of Social Security in the United States, and the key importance of the insurance and investment industry lobby operating through successive Conservative governments in Ontario, are highlighted as critical factors which affected the timing and limited the scope of Canada's public pension system. The residualist design of Old Age Security in 1951 and Ontario's success in gaining a veto over reforms to the Canada Pension Plan in 1965 are singled out as a key factors behind the current vulnerability of Canadian public pensions to fiscal cutbacks compared to the Social Security in the United States.</alinea></resume><resume lang="fr"><titre>Résumé</titre><alinea>Le présent texte analyse quatre des facteurs qui ont influencé la mise en place d'un régime de pensions de vieillesse au Canada après la Deuxième Guerre mondiale.

Si les régimes de pensions canadiens sont actuellement plus vulnérables aux compressions budgétaires que les programmes de sécurité sociale des États-Unis, c'est entre autres et surtout parce que le programme d'assistance aux vieillard dans le besoin a été élaboré à partir d'un projet résiduel et parce que l'Ontario a réussi à obtenir en 1965 un droit de veto sur les réformes du régime de pensions du Canada.</alinea></resume></liminaire><corps><texte typetexte="roc"><alinea>Building a Culture of Retirement: Class, Politics</alinea><alinea>and Pensions in Post-World War II Ontario</alinea><alinea>JAMES STRUTHERS</alinea><alinea>INDUSTRY IS NOT OPPOSED TO PENSIONS.

Before</alinea><alinea>World War II, less than 8 per cent of Canadian workers belonged to company</alinea><alinea>pension plans. By the early 1960s, over 15,000 such plans were in place, cov-</alinea><alinea>ering approximately one-third of the labour force.2 In 1951, the federal gov-</alinea><alinea>ernment enacted an old-age security scheme, providing a universal pension of</alinea><alinea>$40 a month to virtually all Canadians aged 70 and over. Fourteen years later,</alinea><alinea>the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans were created, adding a second tier of</alinea><alinea>wage-related contributory pensions to the existing floor of retirement benefits</alinea><alinea>available through old-age security. The threshold for state pension entitlement</alinea><alinea>was lowered from age 70 to 65 and the new Guaranteed Income Supplement</alinea><alinea>provided a floor below which the incomes of Canada's elderly would not be</alinea><alinea>allowed to fall. With some modifications, this three-tiered Canadian pension</alinea><alinea>system remains in place today. The combined assets of government and private</alinea><alinea>pension plans at present equal 38 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product.</alinea><alinea>Federal spending on old-age pensions has, for quite some time, represented the</alinea><alinea>single largest claim on the national budget.

Most other Western industrial nations, including the United States, had</alinea><alinea>developed extensive state systems of income security for the elderly before the</alinea><alinea>1950s. South of the border, the spread of occupational pensions along with the</alinea><alinea>concept of mandatory retirement at age 65 was a pronounced feature of American</alinea><alinea>welfare capitalism by the late 1920s.4 But retirement as a mass cultural pheno-</alinea><alinea>menon in Canada, as elsewhere in the industrial world, surely came of age in the</alinea><alinea>quarter century of dramatic economic and welfare-state expansion after 1945.5</alinea><alinea>Although retirement is a transnational development that spans advanced</alinea><alinea>capitalist democracies, the policy paths underpinning it and their often unfore-</alinea><alinea>seen consequences are unique to each nation.6 Dramatic changes in Canadian</alinea><alinea>pension policy over the past two years underscore this point and suggest the</alinea><alinea>need for another look at some of the original debates surrounding the creation</alinea><alinea>of our pension system. In 1995, Ottawa announced the end of universal old-age</alinea><alinea>security, to be replaced by a new family income-tested seniors' benefit. This</alinea><alinea>past year, federal officials negotiated with the provinces a dramatic 73 per cent</alinea><alinea>hike in contribution rates for the Canada Pension Plan, combined with a reduc-</alinea><alinea>tion in benefits. Both of these reforms are to be phased in over the next five</alinea><alinea>years. Claiming that Canada's public pension system was "broken and needs to</alinea><alinea>be fixed," federal Finance Minister, Paul Martin Jr., argued that he had no alter-</alinea><alinea>native but "to slash old-age benefits in order to save them." Meanwhile, the</alinea><alinea>Reform Party, right-wing think tanks and the business press have gone much</alinea><alinea>further, calling for the wholesale replacement of Canada's public pension system</alinea><alinea>3    Deaton, Political Economy of Pensions, 238; John Myles, "Conflict, Crisis, and the Future of</alinea><alinea>Old Age Security," in Readings in the Political Economy of Aging.

In what ways did differences in the timing,</alinea><alinea>institutional history, and political economy of pension bargaining, particularly</alinea><alinea>in Ontario in the critical quarter century after World War II, limit the subsequent</alinea><alinea>scope of public provision for Canada's elderly?

The first is the legacy of Canada's means-</alinea><alinea>tested old-age pension program which preceded it. The second stems from the</alinea><alinea>class politics of pension bargaining between business and organised labour in</alinea><alinea>both Canada and the United States during the later years of the 1940s. The third</alinea><alinea>is the powerful policy example, from 1935 onwards, of social security south of</alinea><alinea>the border. The fourth is the key importance of Canada's investment and insur-</alinea><alinea>ance industry on all government policy making over pensions, particularly</alinea><alinea>through its influence on successive Conservative governments within the</alinea><alinea>province of Ontario.</alinea><alinea>Unlike American social security, Canada's first pension plan was a product</alinea><alinea>of the 1920s, not the Great Depression. As a consequence, its principal objec-</alinea><alinea>tive was relieving the need of the indigent aged, not accelerating the retirement</alinea><alinea>of elderly workers in order to free up employment for young.10 Means-tested</alinea><alinea>pensions symbolised more than charity or poor relief. As James Snell, Ann</alinea><alinea>Orloff and other historians have recently argued, Canada's first pension plan did</alinea><alinea>embody a quasi-right of citizenship which acknowledged the elderly's contri-</alinea><alinea>butions in building up the nation.11 But it was not social insurance. Instead, this</alinea><alinea>"citizen's wage" focussed on the relationship between poverty and old age, not</alinea><alinea>the prior payment of premiums or even attachment to the labour force, which is</alinea><alinea>why it was paid out on equal terms and conditions to both men and women.</alinea><alinea>Although means-tested pensions conveyed stigma, they also embodied an early</alinea><alinea>acknowledgement of the equivalent importance of the paid and unpaid labour</alinea><alinea>of men and women in nation building, setting an important precedent for the</alinea><alinea>next stage of pension policy.12</alinea><alinea>Nonetheless, the means test was stigmatising, particularly because the pen-</alinea><alinea>sion scheme received its baptism of fire during the Great Depression. As a con-</alinea><alinea>sequence, cash-strapped provincial governments along with Ottawa tried every</alinea><alinea>way they could to limit payments to a minimum through vigorous enforcement</alinea><alinea>of parental maintenance regulations and a searching scrutiny of bank accounts</alinea><alinea>and property transfers from parents to children.13 The result, by the 1940s, was</alinea><alinea>widespread public disgust for the means test and the provincial pension bureau-</alinea><alinea>10  On the importance of American Social Security as a "retirement-inducing," anti-unemployment</alinea><alinea>measure, see Graebner, History of Retirement, 181-214.</alinea><alinea>11   On the OAP's creation of a "culture of entitlement," see Snell, Citizen's Wage, 112-14; Orloff,</alinea><alinea>Politics of Pensions, 265; on the contradiction as to whether OAP was an "earned right" or</alinea><alinea>"charity," see James Struthers,  The Limits of Affluence:  Welfare in Ontario,  1920-1970</alinea><alinea>(Toronto, 1994), 75-6.</alinea><alinea>12  Snell notes that "for many women the OAP represented their first source of regular, significant</alinea><alinea>income independent of husbands or family," Citizen's Wage, 124.</alinea><alinea>13  James Struthers, "Regulating the Elderly: Old Age Pensions and the Formation of a Pension</alinea><alinea>Bureaucracy in Ontario, 1929-1945," Journal of the Canadian Historical Association 3 (1992):</alinea><alinea>235-56.</alinea><alinea>262</alinea><alinea>BUILDING A CULTURE OF RETIREMENT</alinea><alinea>cracies that administered it. As federal officials planning pension reforms</alinea><alinea>acknowledged by 1949, "Regardless of its merits or demerits even if generously</alinea><alinea>conceived, the means test has fallen into such disrepute that public opinion will</alinea><alinea>not be satisfied with anything short of its complete abolition."14</alinea><alinea>The most effective opposition to the means test came from organised</alinea><alinea>labour. Indeed, the union campaign for abolition of the means test represented</alinea><alinea>perhaps the labour movement's most successful intervention into social politics</alinea><alinea>before the 1960s. Union pressure on pensions came from both sides of the bor-</alinea><alinea>der and reflected the burgeoning strength of mass industrial unionism, particu-</alinea><alinea>larly in the steel and automobile sector, the unusual circumstances and aftermath</alinea><alinea>of wartime wage stabilisation policies, and the growing political frustration of</alinea><alinea>labour leaders with the fading promise of postwar reconstruction.</alinea><alinea>In the United States and Canada, union membership more than doubled</alinea><alinea>during the 1940s under the stimulus of full employment and the protective</alinea><alinea>umbrella of the Wagner Act and Canada's equivalent, RC. 1003. Although</alinea><alinea>workers were joining unions in record numbers, government price and income</alinea><alinea>regulations restricted their ability to bargain for higher wages. Through changes</alinea><alinea>in tax law, however, both the American and Canadian governments created</alinea><alinea>strong incentives for occupational pension plans as a form of "deferred wages,"</alinea><alinea>by allowing employers in the US and employers and workers in Canada to</alinea><alinea>deduct their contributions to private pension plans against the excess profits tax</alinea><alinea>and personal income tax. With this new fiscal encouragement and in the</alinea><alinea>absence of other economic incentives to attract or hold valued workers, com-</alinea><alinea>panies began creating pension plans in record numbers and the percentage of</alinea><alinea>the workforce included in such schemes doubled on both sides of the border</alinea><alinea>between 1938 and 1947.15</alinea><alinea>Many, if not most, of these pension schemes were unilateral company initia-</alinea><alinea>tives in which workers enjoyed weak vested rights and their unions little policy</alinea><alinea>input. In the Steel Company of Canada, for example, union officials com-</alinea><alinea>plained bitterly that "the company has always taken the view that the pension</alinea><alinea>14  "Our Gestapo for the Aged," Vancouver Sun, 3 December 1940, as cited in James Snell, "The</alinea><alinea>First Grey Lobby: the Old Age Pensioners' Organization of British Columbia 1932-1951," BC</alinea><alinea>Studies 102 (Summer 1994): 17; Canada, National Archives (NA), RG 29, Records of the</alinea><alinea>Department of National Health and Welfare, Vol. 2376, File 275-4-2, (1), "Memorandum</alinea><alinea>Regarding Old Age Security," n.d but circa 1949.</alinea><alinea>15  Deaton, Political Economy of Pensions, 81. As Liberal MP David Croll noted in Parliament</alinea><alinea>during the 1950 debates on Old Age Security, "sixty-four per cent of our present operative [pen-</alinea><alinea>sion] plans came into effect during the war . . . During the war years wages could not be raised</alinea><alinea>but pensions could be granted. Employers wanted to hold their employees. Possibly other peo-</alinea><alinea>ple were offering them more money, so employers provided for pensions. All the money they</alinea><alinea>were paying out for pensions in the war years was deductible as it is now, except that at that</alinea><alinea>time, there was more of it. Therefore, these pension plans grew," Canada.

One of the needs in our situation is to break</alinea><alinea>down this attitude. . .as well as get access to company payroll records which</alinea><alinea>will enable [our] actuaries to make their surveys."16 Beginning in 1947, union</alinea><alinea>leaders, particularly in the newly organised mass-production industries, began</alinea><alinea>targetting pensions along with other so-called "fringe benefits" as a means of</alinea><alinea>demonstrating the efficacy of their organisations to the membership, particu-</alinea><alinea>larly in the face of restrictive labour legislation such as the Taft-Hartley Act and</alinea><alinea>declining political support for the New Deal or postwar reconstruction policies.</alinea><alinea>As Beth Stevens has recently argued, the American labour movement's "turn to</alinea><alinea>employee benefits was a reaction to [its] decreasing ability to influence public</alinea><alinea>sector decisions about social programs. .. [as well as] part of a counter-drive by</alinea><alinea>unions to consolidate their disintegrating collective bargaining rights." For its</alinea><alinea>part, the Truman administration looked favourably upon negotiations over</alinea><alinea>fringe benefits as a relatively low-cost means of dampening the fires of union</alinea><alinea>unrest. In a landmark decision in 1948, for example, the US National Labor</alinea><alinea>Relations Board ruled that company pension plans should indeed come under</alinea><alinea>the scope of collective bargaining.17</alinea><alinea>During the later 1940s, Canadian labour leaders faced similar challenges in</alinea><alinea>their collective bargaining environment and a worsening political climate for</alinea><alinea>social reform in the face of Cold War politics and waning public support for the</alinea><alinea>CCF. Legislation protecting workers against insecurity in old age, the Canadian</alinea><alinea>Congress of Labour's assistant research director pointed out early in 1949, was</alinea><alinea>"either non-existent or at best inadequate." "Under the circumstances," he</alinea><alinea>advised CCL affiliates, "unions have no alternative but... to bargain for the</alinea><alinea>inclusion in collective agreements of pension and health and welfare schemes."</alinea><alinea>Their goal should be pensions "large enough to permit retirement without dis-</alinea><alinea>satisfaction. . . . The employer regularly sets up reserves for depreciation and</alinea><alinea>obsolescence of equipment. ... It is only reasonable to demand, therefore, that</alinea><alinea>similar reserves should be set up for employees who, to use the same expres-</alinea><alinea>sions, have depreciated in usefulness and become obsolete due to age."18</alinea><alinea>As affiliates of American international unions, Canadian labour leaders</alinea><alinea>also responded to a collective bargaining agenda being set south of the border.</alinea><alinea>Early in 1949, for example, UAW president Walter Reuther defined his union's</alinea><alinea>key bargaining objective during the upcoming Ford negotiations to be a $100</alinea><alinea>monthly pension payable at age 65 after 30 years service.

We'll co-ordinate our activities,</alinea><alinea>pool our strength and the companies will be told we will settle only if people</alinea><alinea>on both sides of the river settle." Canadian workers, Reuther vowed, would "no</alinea><alinea>longer be treated as second class citizens."20 After a difficult 1949 strike Ford</alinea><alinea>workers at both Windsor and Detroit won a path-breaking $55 a month non-</alinea><alinea>contributory pension.21 But there was one key difference. In the United States,</alinea><alinea>the $55 dollar Ford pension would be integrated into a $45 monthly social secu-</alinea><alinea>rity benefit to produce a minimum retirement wage of $100 dollars a month. In</alinea><alinea>Canada, there was no state pension at age 65. At age 70, the $55 monthly pay-</alinea><alinea>ment would simply be deducted against any income which might be available</alinea><alinea>from Canada's means-tested OAP.</alinea><alinea>This stark contrast galvanised the Canadian Congress of Labour into polit-</alinea><alinea>ical as well as economic action on the pension front, by mobilising a national</alinea><alinea>campaign to have the means test abolished. "It would be sheer folly for us to</alinea><alinea>suggest that anything short of a combined company and government retirement</alinea><alinea>plan could provide the workers in the industry with an adequate pension,"</alinea><alinea>Steelworker officials argued late in 1949.

The</alinea><alinea>Prime Minister's office, Health and Welfare Minister Paul Martin later recalled,</alinea><alinea>was simply "inundated" with this correspondence.24 By the end of March, "as</alinea><alinea>the result of an overwhelming public clamour," according to one influential</alinea><alinea>Liberal backbencher, the St. Laurent administration appointed a joint Senate-</alinea><alinea>House of Commons Parliamentary Committee to investigate proposals for a</alinea><alinea>new national pension scheme. Out of the June report of this committee emerged</alinea><alinea>recommendations for a universal old-age security pension of $40 a month,</alinea><alinea>payable to all Canadians upon reaching the age of 70.25</alinea><alinea>Labour's indirect influence on the creation of old-age security, however,</alinea><alinea>was probably more effective than its advertising campaign. By forcing employ-</alinea><alinea>ers to bargain over pension plans for the first time during the 1949 and 1950</alinea><alinea>automobile and steel agreements, the labour movement shifted critical sectors</alinea><alinea>of Canadian business opinion as well as right-wing elements in the Liberal cab-</alinea><alinea>inet in favour of a universal public pension entitlement. As The Globe and Mail</alinea><alinea>noted late in 1949:</alinea><alinea>the widespread labor demand for industrial pension plans as part of its 1950</alinea><alinea>collective bargaining program has had a marked influence on government</alinea><alinea>thinking... . Today the national pension plan is being considered as something</alinea><alinea>which will provide the foundations on which industrial pension plans will be</alinea><alinea>built. . . . Not only has there been pressure this time from labor, but there have</alinea><alinea>been approaches from industry indicating support for a national plan about</alinea><alinea>which in the past it has been, to say the least, apathetic.26</alinea><alinea>As other media commentators noted, "Some industrialists who previously</alinea><alinea>weren't too enthusiastic about the government spending money on social secu-</alinea><alinea>rity have had a change of heart. ...

And so company executives have joined the</alinea><alinea>trek to Ottawa to get the means test abolished."27</alinea><alinea>As indeed they did. At Parliamentary Committee hearings into old-age</alinea><alinea>pensions, briefs from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian</alinea><alinea>Life Insurance Officers Association endorsed abolishing the means test and</alinea><alinea>moving towards a system of univeral old-age pensions. "Everybody pays,</alinea><alinea>everybody benefits," the Chamber of Commerce argued. "It is a pay-as-you go</alinea><alinea>plan under which citizens lay aside so much of their yearly income to buy their</alinea><alinea>means of living in later years." Money going to those who did not need it could</alinea><alinea>be "partly recouped by means of taxation." Life insurance industry spokesmen</alinea><alinea>agreed. Universal old-age security payments represented "nothing more than . . .</alinea><alinea>an extension to the community at large of the old-time principle operated within</alinea><alinea>the family itself. This method is a true pay-as-you-go basis of old age pensions</alinea><alinea>and recognizes that the immediate, most pressing problem at any time consists</alinea><alinea>of the current old age population."28</alinea><alinea>Business and Liberal government support for universal old-age security in</alinea><alinea>1950 was clearly a response to labour's success in pension bargaining as well</alinea><alinea>as partly a reaction to the Cold War itself. "You cannot triumph over commu-</alinea><alinea>nism by force alone," Paul Martin reminded Parliament in defence of the legis-</alinea><alinea>lation once the Korean War broke out.29 But it also reflected the fact that the</alinea><alinea>27  Robert McKeown, "What's Ahead for Pensions?" Canadian Welfare 26 (15 April 1950). This</alinea><alinea>view was pushed most adamantly by Health and Welfare minister Paul Martin, whose Windsor</alinea><alinea>riding was the site of the path-breaking 1949 Ford strike over pensions. Once the Ford strike</alinea><alinea>had been settled, Martin tentatively endorsed the idea of a non-contributory universal old-age</alinea><alinea>pension. As the Toronto Star commented, "he tied it in with the recent announcement by Ford</alinea><alinea>in the U.S. of a $100 a month pension plan for its workers. . . . This is how it would work out.</alinea><alinea>There is a tremendous move in industry today for retirement pensions. ... It is believed that if</alinea><alinea>companies knew their employees would get, at 70, $40 a month from the federal government,</alinea><alinea>more of them would proceed with retirement plans. A firm could retire an employee on $80 a</alinea><alinea>month at 65 and then reduce its contribution to $40 a month at 70 when the federal government</alinea><alinea>plan benefits were available." Robert Taylor, "See Firms Giving $80 Retirement Pay at 65 Until</alinea><alinea>Pensions Due at 70," Toronto Star, 4 October 1949. Conservative opposition members of</alinea><alinea>Parliament also linked their support of universal pensions to labour unrest. "Adequate provision</alinea><alinea>for retirement in advanced years is one of the avowed objectives of organized labour. A national</alinea><alinea>contributory pension plan can make a major contribution to industrial peace," Canada.

Nor did it contain any formula for indexation. For</alinea><alinea>those with no other source of income it was "an outrageous pittance," the</alinea><alinea>Canadian Congress of Labour argued. "The government has achieved the polit-</alinea><alinea>ical minimum," social work observers quipped. "The lowest sum per month at</alinea><alinea>the highest age that they dared to suggest."30</alinea><alinea>Yet ensuring either adequacy or early retirement for the elderly was never</alinea><alinea>Ottawa's intent. "It would be a great mistake for Government even to appear to</alinea><alinea>monopolize the field by undertaking a complex and ambitious insurance</alinea><alinea>scheme which would be expected to provide adequate pensions on retirement</alinea><alinea>for everybody," Health and Welfare officials advised the Liberal cabinet in</alinea><alinea>designing the scheme.

"The OAI provisions . . . represented an approach to</alinea><alinea>social welfare created by private businessmen. They retained the joint contributory format of</alinea><alinea>private pension plans and did little to redistribute income.

Quadagno, The Transformation of Old</alinea><alinea>Age Security: Class and Politics in the American Welfare State (Chicago, 1988), 113; Edward</alinea><alinea>D.

Despite forecasting a huge budgetary sur-</alinea><alinea>plus, Finance Minister Walter Harris agreed to only a $6 increase in monthly</alinea><alinea>OAS payments. Although this $6 adjustment did reflect changes in price levels</alinea><alinea>since 1952, the Liberals, according to cabinet minister Jack Pickersgill, were</alinea><alinea>afraid to make this argument in its defence, "for fear of creating the expectation</alinea><alinea>that old age pensions would in future be tied to the cost of living."37</alinea><alinea>Health and Welfare Minister Paul Martin, who had lobbied hard for a $10</alinea><alinea>increase, complained privately to the local Windsor-area press that the $6 boost</alinea><alinea>was "cheese-paring, Chiselling. We would have been better off to have left it</alinea><alinea>alone than to come up with $6. It's psychologically cockeyed because it looks and</alinea><alinea>sounds mean." The government was hammered in Parliament and in the media</alinea><alinea>by Conservative opposition leader John Diefenbaker who gleefully dubbed the</alinea><alinea>finance minister "Six Buck Harris."38 The miserly nature of the pension increase</alinea><alinea>played a significant role in the Liberals unexpected defeat by Diefenbaker in</alinea><alinea>the 1957 federal election.</alinea><alinea>On forming a minority government, Diefenbaker wasted no time in boost-</alinea><alinea>ing old-age security payments to $55 a month. But this 37.5 per cent increase in</alinea><alinea>the basic flat-rate pension between 1957 and 1958 prompted both the Conserva-</alinea><alinea>tives and Liberals to begin re-examining some of the fundamental premises of</alinea><alinea>Canada's universal pension system, and to take a closer look at America's alter-</alinea><alinea>native. Going into the 1958 federal election, Diefenbaker promised that it</alinea><alinea>would "not be very long before we will be in a position to introduce in the new</alinea><alinea>parliament a contributory social security system." American workers, he noted,</alinea><alinea>could now draw retirement benefits "as high as $108.50 a month at age 65."</alinea><alinea>Accordingly, he appointed a federal inquiry to discover "how best we can</alinea><alinea>expand the present old age pension system by the addition of an insurance sys-</alinea><alinea>tem similar to that of the United States."39 Not to be outdone, the Liberal party's</alinea><alinea>36  As John Myles points out, America's Social Security Act provided "a policy framework of earn-</alinea><alinea>ings-related benefits that allowed subsequent generations of reformers to construct a system of</alinea><alinea>retirement wages through what would appear to be a series of incremental reforms rather than</alinea><alinea>a radical transformation of the policy structure itself." Within Canada, in contrast, "comparable</alinea><alinea>results could be achieved only through radically new policy initiatives to construct an earnings-</alinea><alinea>related system on top of the existing flat-rate benefit structure."

Ontario was home to more than</alinea><alinea>half of all private pension plans in Canada, as well as the increasingly power-</alinea><alinea>ful insurance and investment industry that managed their assets. "A large pro-</alinea><alinea>portion of Canada's workers already possess supplementary retirement coverage,"</alinea><alinea>chief provincial economist George Gathercole advised Conservative Premier</alinea><alinea>Leslie Frost shortly after the 1958 federal election:</alinea><alinea>Would it therefore be wise at this time, when the basic pension has recently</alinea><alinea>been increased and the provincial and federal governments are embarking</alinea><alinea>upon a joint hospital insurance program, to channel substantially greater funds</alinea><alinea>into a field which is being met reasonably well by the combination of old age</alinea><alinea>security programs, both public and private, now in force? . . . [T]o jettison the</alinea><alinea>Canadian social security system for the American plan would be a mistake.41</alinea><alinea>Insurance industry organisations agreed. State pensions should be "limited</alinea><alinea>to providing only a minimum subsistence level of income" rather than a "stan-</alinea><alinea>dard of living in old age equal to that enjoyed during pensioners' working years.</alinea><alinea>. . . Further provisions . . . must be the responsibility of the individuals con-</alinea><alinea>cerned."42 A $55 monthly pension was "already high in relation to earnings in</alinea><alinea>certain low income areas." To add on a state contributory plan, industry execu-</alinea><alinea>tives argued, "would take us well... into the area of major income redistribution.</alinea><alinea>It would begin to compete seriously with private pension plans."43 In the spring</alinea><alinea>of 1960 they formed the Canadian Pension Conference, a permanent lobby</alinea><alinea>group composed of insurance officials, actuaries and employers with major</alinea><alinea>pension plans, to "act as an unofficial watchdog over governments in the area</alinea><alinea>of pensions."44</alinea><alinea>40  "Contributory Pensions New Liberal Plank: Benefits at Age 65 in Pearson Plan," Windsor Daily</alinea><alinea>Star, 20 March 1958.</alinea><alinea>41   AO, RG 6, Records of the Ministry of Treasury and Economics, Series ITI-I, UF 68, File</alinea><alinea>"American OASI," George Gathercole to Leslie Frost, 16 Tune 1958.</alinea><alinea>42  Ibid., File "Old Age Security Program," Department of Economics memo, "A Survey of the Old</alinea><alinea>Age Security Programme Existing in Canada," February 1960, p. 2.</alinea><alinea>43  Ibid., UF 74, File "Portable Pensions," address of Laurence Coward, vice-president and chief</alinea><alinea>actuary of William Mercer Ltd., September 1958.</alinea><alinea>44  "Canadian Pension Conference New Watchdog on Lawmakers," Financial Post, 11 June 1960.</alinea><alinea>271</alinea><alinea>JOURNAL OF THE CHA 1997 REVUE DE LA S.H.C.</alinea><alinea>While the pension industry was mobilising its forces in Ontario against the</alinea><alinea>move towards a contributory scheme, other reports began painting a different</alinea><alinea>picture of the world of private pensions. A two-year research study of the</alinea><alinea>"Economic Needs and Resources of Older People in Ontario" issued by the</alinea><alinea>Ontario Welfare Council in 1959 pointed out that while 30 per cent of the work</alinea><alinea>force belonged to private pension plans, only 10 per cent of those 65 and over</alinea><alinea>received any benefits from them, with the average payment running at less than</alinea><alinea>$500 a year. The majority of plans required more than ten years service for the</alinea><alinea>vesting of pension benefits. In almost half the plans surveyed 20 years of ser-</alinea><alinea>vice was the required standard. As a result, "most workers, being employed by</alinea><alinea>a series of firms during their working life, are unable to build up adequate, if</alinea><alinea>any, pension credits." Arguing that $86 to $98 a month for a single person and</alinea><alinea>$135 to $149 for a couple was the minimum income necessary for a "modest</alinea><alinea>budget... consistent with health, decency, and self-respect," the report claimed</alinea><alinea>that "at least forty per cent and perhaps as high as sixty per cent of Ontario's</alinea><alinea>population aged 65 and over do not have incomes ... [at this] level." A com-</alinea><alinea>pulsory government contributory pension scheme was the "best means for most</alinea><alinea>people to achieve economic security in old age."45</alinea><alinea>A more definitive study of Canada's elderly completed by the Dominion</alinea><alinea>Bureau of Statistics a few years later revealed that 54 per cent of those aged 65</alinea><alinea>or over had incomes below $1000 a year. While households led by the aged in</alinea><alinea>1961 represented only 12 per cent of all Canadian families, they comprised</alinea><alinea>almost one-third of those earning less than $2000 annually. Put differently, 37</alinea><alinea>per cent of all families led by the aged were defined as low income. For the</alinea><alinea>aged living on their own, the risk of poverty was more severe as 60 per cent</alinea><alinea>lived on less than $1000 a year. Elderly women, who represented two-thirds of</alinea><alinea>this number, had the greatest chance of being poor.

Most employers,</alinea><alinea>provincial economist George Gathercole conceded, were also "reluctant to</alinea><alinea>engage an older worker because they fear that he would become an embarass-</alinea><alinea>ment to them, and would not be able to accumulate an adequate pension during</alinea><alinea>his remaining years of service. . .. The employer . . . prefers to avoid the prob-</alinea><alinea>lem by simply barring him from employment." As study after study pointed</alinea><alinea>out, "a pension plan with its advantages for a firm's employees seems to have</alinea><alinea>the disadvantage of raising a barrier against the hiring of ... older people."48</alinea><alinea>When unemployment deepened during the recession years of 1958-1962,</alinea><alinea>the contribution of pension plans to the newly discovered phenomenon of age</alinea><alinea>discrimination and the prolonged joblessness of men over 40 drew wider pub-</alinea><alinea>lic outrage, particularly among trade unionists. "Industry today is going out of</alinea><alinea>its way to force the . . . union movement to revise all its thinking about pen-</alinea><alinea>sions," the Ontario Federation of Labour argued in 1959:</alinea><alinea>Industry has decided that a man is old at 40.

"The loss of pension</alinea><alinea>rights ... cannot be permitted to continue," Frost warned members of the Canadian</alinea><alinea>Pension Conference in justifying his intervention. "In this age of rapid techno-</alinea><alinea>logical change the economy demands that our labour force be relatively mobile.</alinea><alinea>...

The premier also told the industry executives that too many plans</alinea><alinea>across the province were "inadequately administered . . . [or] in a precarious</alinea><alinea>financial position." Unless these problems were solved "in a businesslike and</alinea><alinea>sound way, without overloading our Governments with vast welfare expendi-</alinea><alinea>tures," there was the possibility "that other arrangements will be devised by the</alinea><alinea>people, other people, to meet the demand for wage-related retirement income."51</alinea><alinea>After deliberating for over two and a half years and consulting widely</alinea><alinea>among the insurance industry and Ontario employers, the portable pension</alinea><alinea>committee produced two drafts of a Portable Pension Plan bill, which finally</alinea><alinea>passed through the Ontario legislature in April 1963. Its principal features were</alinea><alinea>to make the creation of private pension plans mandatory for all firms in Ontario</alinea><alinea>employing 15 or more workers. Employer contributions would be vested for all</alinea><alinea>workers with at least ten years service upon reaching the age of 45 and employ-</alinea><alinea>ees would also be unable to withdraw their own pension contributions after this</alinea><alinea>point. Plans would be financed so as to yield a minimum $100 monthly pension</alinea><alinea>at age 65 after 35 years of service. An Ontario Pension Commission would</alinea><alinea>oversee the registration and standards of solvency for all private pension</alinea><alinea>schemes in the province.52</alinea><alinea>The Portable Pension Act reflected "the virtues of the Ontario free enter-</alinea><alinea>prise approach," government officials bragged. Although the benefits were</alinea><alinea>"admittedly modest," they had been set "at a level that avoids imposing on</alinea><alinea>industry a burden that might adversely affect its competitive position." Nor did</alinea><alinea>the plan "involve any taxation, subsidization, or cross-subsidization." In partic-</alinea><alinea>ular, because the benefits paid would be fully funded, they did "not involve sub-</alinea><alinea>stantial subsidies from one generation to another."

If the confusion and uncertainty of the pri-</alinea><alinea>vate pension sector were not quickly reformed, "we are going to witness the</alinea><alinea>extension of a government programme which might even be more drastic than</alinea><alinea>what we are suggesting."54</alinea><alinea>Two months after the passage of Ontario's Portable Pension Act,</alinea><alinea>Gathercole's prediction proved correct. A newly elected Liberal government,</alinea><alinea>led by Lester Pearson, promised to introduce legislation leading to a new state</alinea><alinea>contributory pension scheme - the Canada Pension Plan - within 60 days of</alinea><alinea>coming to power, a development that caught Ontario's Conservative govern-</alinea><alinea>ment fully off guard. Prior to the introduction of the Canada Pension Plan, fed-</alinea><alinea>eral officials noted, "it was apparent that the Ontario Government considered</alinea><alinea>that [its portable pension] approach would complement the flat rate old age</alinea><alinea>security benefit and that no public contributory program would be necessary if</alinea><alinea>the other provinces and the federal government would adopt comparable legis-</alinea><alinea>lation."55 In essence this was both Leslie Frost's and John Robarts' vision for a</alinea><alinea>new national pension system. The moment the details of the Liberal plan were</alinea><alinea>announced by Health and Welfare Minister Judy LaMarsh at a federal-provin-</alinea><alinea>cial conference in July 1963, however, Ontario's Portable Pension bill was</alinea><alinea>politically dead. The Ontario Federation of Labour quickly pointed out the key</alinea><alinea>difference for the province's workers between the two schemes:</alinea><alinea>Under the Ontario plan, a man could work 40 years and still get only 20% ben-</alinea><alinea>efits. . . . Under the proposed federal plan, a man could get 30% benefits after</alinea><alinea>working only 10 years. The Robarts plan for this province is a bonanza for the</alinea><alinea>insurance companies and pension specialists. It sets out the conditions and</alinea><alinea>then turns the pension business, including control of the funds, over to the pri-</alinea><alinea>vate companies .... The federal plan is a public enterprise concept. . .

Business interests,</alinea><alinea>mobilised through the Canadian Pension Conference and the financial press,</alinea><alinea>vehemently opposed any expansion of the "Quebec model" through wider CPP</alinea><alinea>coverage.67</alinea><alinea>This position received strong support from an old ally, the Ontario govern-</alinea><alinea>ment, which throughout the Great Pension Debate "continuefd] to oppose</alinea><alinea>an enrichment of CPP benefits." Ontario's Conservative government treasurer</alinea><alinea>warned Ottawa that his province would "not let the CPP degenerate into another</alinea><alinea>federally-administered welfare plan." As Keith Banting argues, throughout the</alinea><alinea>1970s and early 1980s Ontario's "basic approach [did] not change: the CPP</alinea><alinea>should not be a tool of income redistribution, and the private sector should be the</alinea><alinea>primary vehicle of retirement saving." With a veto over any changes to the CPP,</alinea><alinea>the province's staunch support of the private pension sector (the banking, insur-</alinea><alinea>ance and mutual fund industry) and industrial capital and its opposition to enrich-</alinea><alinea>ing CPP benefits remained a critical factor in the realpolitik of pension reform.68</alinea><alinea>So too did the weakness of Canadian seniors' organisations which lacked</alinea><alinea>the equivalent size, strength and media sophistication of the American</alinea><alinea>Association of Retired Persons, the National Council of Senior Citizens, or the</alinea><alinea>umbrella seniors' coalition, Save Our Security, south of the border.

The</alinea><alinea>end result, as Myles and Teichroew point out, was to "reinforce the economic</alinea><alinea>divisions that generated the [Great Pension Debate] in the first place: better-</alinea><alinea>quality occupational pensions (for those covered), more tax shelters for the</alinea><alinea>well-to-do (RRSPs) and little or nothing for those whose retirement income</alinea><alinea>depends almost exclusively on the public sector."71 By the end of the 1980s</alinea><alinea>Canada continued to spend a smaller percentage of its GDP on public pensions</alinea><alinea>than any other OECD nation except Australia and Japan and provided one of</alinea><alinea>the lowest ratios of average wage replacement for retirees.72</alinea><alinea>As this analysis of key developments in Ontario has shown, organised</alinea><alinea>labour, the federal and provincial state, along with the burgeoning private pen-</alinea><alinea>sion industry shaped and constrained the evolution of Canada's pension system</alinea><alinea>within particular limits arising out of the legacy of the earlier means-tested pen-</alinea><alinea>sion scheme. Labour's success in incorporating pensions in the framework of</alinea><alinea>collective bargaining during the 1940s and 1950s pushed the boundaries of both</alinea><alinea>federal and provincial pension policy in two significant ways. First, pension</alinea><alinea>bargaining by industrial unions between 1949 and 1950 played a key role in</alinea><alinea>moving both the federal cabinet and business leaders towards creating a uni-</alinea><alinea>versal, basic public pension entitlement that could be blended into industry</alinea><alinea>plans. Second, throughout the 1950s, the rapid expansion of private plans</alinea><alinea>through collective bargaining triggered a growing awareness of new problems</alinea><alinea>being created by pensions themselves.</alinea><alinea>Age discrimination against older workers, inadequate vesting and portabil-</alinea><alinea>70  Myles and Teichroew, "The Politics of Dualism," 95.</alinea><alinea>71  Ibid., 96; Deaton, Political Economy of Pensions, 114.</alinea><alinea>72  Myles and Teichroew, "The Politics of Dualism," 86. In 1985, Canada spent 5.4 per cent of</alinea><alinea>GDP on public old-age pensions. "The United States, with a similar age profile, spent 7.2 per</alinea><alinea>cent of GDP." According to The Economist (November 30-December 6, 1996), out of 16 lead-</alinea><alinea>ing industrial nations Canada ranked number 12 in its percentage (33 per cent) of average wage</alinea><alinea>replacement through public pensions.</alinea><alinea>280</alinea><alinea>BUILDING A CULTURE OF RETIREMENT</alinea><alinea>ity of hard-won worker pension rights, weak financing of many private</alinea><alinea>schemes, and the low percentage of workers who actually collected a private</alinea><alinea>pension upon retirement were all singled out as glaring evidence of the need for</alinea><alinea>fundamental policy reform by the decade's end. The contradictions and ineffi-</alinea><alinea>ciencies of the private pension system alongside the basic inadequacy of</alinea><alinea>Ottawa's unindexed old-age security scheme converged, by 1958, to create the</alinea><alinea>political momentum for support of a new second-tier contributory public pen-</alinea><alinea>sion scheme. The continued liberalisation of America's old-age insurance for</alinea><alinea>the elderly throughout the 1950s also intensified political pressure for providing</alinea><alinea>comparable levels of wage replacement to Canadian workers on their retirement.</alinea><alinea>At this critical policy juncture, decisions by the Ontario government and</alinea><alinea>the province's burgeoning private pension industry played a significant role in</alinea><alinea>constraining the subsequent path of pension policy development. To forestall</alinea><alinea>the growing movement for contributory public pensions, successive Ontario</alinea><alinea>Conservative governments, led by Leslie Frost and John Robarts, worked to</alinea><alinea>develop a regime of regulated and mandatory private pensions which they</alinea><alinea>hoped could be expanded, through federal-provincial co-operation, into a</alinea><alinea>national pension system. When this campaign was blocked through the launch-</alinea><alinea>ing of the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans, neither successive Conservative</alinea><alinea>governments within Ontario, nor the private pension industry were reconciled</alinea><alinea>to anything more than grudging acceptance of a residual role for contributory</alinea><alinea>public pensions, a position vigorously defended with the help of Ontario's veto</alinea><alinea>over CPP reform during the Great Pension Debate between 1976-1984. As a</alinea><alinea>consequence, both the province and its insurance industry allies have worked</alinea><alinea>consistently over the past two decades to keep the income security guarantees</alinea><alinea>of Canada's public pension system among the lowest in the Western industrial-</alinea><alinea>ized world.</alinea><alinea>This policy legacy may have important consequences for pension reform in</alinea><alinea>Canada in the next century. South of the border, as Theda Skocpol points out,</alinea><alinea>"there has been ... no political backlash against Social Security," even during</alinea><alinea>the highwater mark of neo-conservative ascendancy during the Reagan era,</alinea><alinea>because of its broad coverage and high levels of retirement benefits paid out to</alinea><alinea>the tax-paying middle and working class. "[O]nce established ... its adminis-</alinea><alinea>trators worked to make benefits higher for everyone, and relatively better for the</alinea><alinea>less privileged, so that benefits could be closer to a sufficient retirement</alinea><alinea>income." Through such "targetting within universalism," social security, by</alinea><alinea>incorporating a broadly based middle-class constituency, became "not only the</alinea><alinea>most politically unassailable part of U.S. public social provision, but also</alinea><alinea>America's most effective antipoverty program."73</alinea><alinea>73 Skocpol, "Targeting within Universalism," 264-5.</alinea><alinea>281</alinea><alinea>JOURNAL OF THE CHA 1997 REVUE DE LA S.H.C.</alinea><alinea>More residualist from its inception, Canada's public pension system, in</alinea><alinea>contrast, has failed to develop comparable levels of middle-class incorporation</alinea><alinea>and is now moving in the opposite direction, away from universality and</alinea><alinea>towards a return to means-tested social assistance rather than social insur-</alinea><alinea>ance.74 With weaker levels of wage replacement and rapidly ballooning costs,</alinea><alinea>public pensions in Canada thus face a more uncertain future as the baby-boom</alinea><alinea>generation heads into retirement over the next three decades.</alinea><alinea>74 Myles and Teichroew, "The Politics of Dualism," 84-104; Lynn McDonald, "Editorial:</alinea><alinea>Retirement for the Rich and Retirement for the Poor: From Social Security to Social Welfare,"</alinea><alinea>Canadian Journal on Aging 14 (1995): 447-51</alinea><alinea>282</alinea><alinea/></texte></corps></article>

McNEELY, Terrain Sciences Division, Geological Survey of Canada, 601 Booth Street,      Ottawa, Ontario K1A OE8.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>INTRODUCTION</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Wagner (1970) reports five thermophilous molluscs in her collections from the late      Pleistocene Champlain Sea of</alinea><alinea>Ontario and Québec. Otherwise, this sea was      dominated by boreal and boreal-arctic faunas. The presence of these thermophiles in proglacial      sediments is surprising. None of them have been previously radiocarbon dated, and therefore,      they are mostly ignored in discussions of the paleoenvironments of the Champlain Sea. Unless      they all represent cultural contamination, or are misidentified, their presence, if      authenticated by 14C dating, would substantially alter interpretations of marine      paleoenvironments in the Champlain Sea and Gulf of St. Lawrence to Gulf of Maine region. These      thermophiles belong today to the Virginian faunistic zone, which is the zone warmed by the      Gulf Stream, and the oyster (Crassostrea virginica), in particular, requires minimum summer      sea surface temperatures of 20 °C for reproduction.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Some Virginian      taxa, including the oyster, now form a disjunct population in the southwestern Gulf of St.      Lawrence.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>This group is separated from the main range of the      Virginian molluscs by a 1300 km wide cold-water gap centred on the</alinea><alinea>Gulf of      Maine. The Virginians evidently extended their range into the Gulf of St. Lawrence sometime      during the late Pleistocene to Early Holocene. They became separated from the main range as      submergence of the continental shelf off New</alinea><alinea>England allowed development of      the high tidal ranges of the region today and therefore destruction of the summer thermal      stratification of the upper water column (Bousfield and</alinea><alinea>Thomas, 1975; Dyke et      al., 1996). Existing chronological data would place the initial incursion of the Virginian      molluscs in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at 7000-8000 years ago. If</alinea><alinea>Wagner's      oysters and other thermophiles are authentic fossils, however, and not from the back door of a      diner, the initial incursion necessarily occurred 10 000-11 500 years ago.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>This would be a very significant revision, with implications for other aspects of late      Pleistocene paleogeography, including the Gulf Stream position and temperature of the      periglacial zone. Accordingly, we attempted to find the critical fossils, confirm      identifications if necessary, and obtain radiocarbon dates. There follows a list of earlier      reports, some reidentifications of shells, and two AMS age determinations.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>PREVIOUS REPORTS</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Sir J.W. Dawson (1893), in his book, The      Canadian Ice</alinea><alinea>Age, records nearly 80 Pleistocene fossils from southeastern      Canada. Among these are reports of the following animals thought to be Virginian or low boreal      in modern distribution (Abbott, 1974):</alinea><alinea>p. 241: Yoldia limatula Say: Leda clay      at Rivière-du-Loup. It now ranges from Gulf of St. Lawrence to Long Island, New York. "The      specimens are as good as any now living in the Gulf. Although they have the number of teeth of      Yoldia limatula, they approach in form the allied species Y. sapotilla." The latter ranges      from</alinea><alinea>Arctic seas to North Carolina.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>p. 243: Ostrea      virginiana Gmelin: "I have picked up a loose specimen at Saco [Maine?] which has the      appearance of being a fossil specimen from the Leda clay and Mr. Paisley has sent me specimens      from the Bay des Chaleurs, which are said to have come from Pleistocene beds 16 feet from the      surface."</alinea><alinea>p. 243: Haminoea solitaria Say: Montréal, rather common. It now      ranges from southwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence to Georgia.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Edward      Ardley (1912, p. 67) of the Redpath Museum of</alinea><alinea>McGill University mentioned two      collections of oysters from the Champlain Sea besides that listed by Dawson. He noted that      "The late Mr. E. T. Chalmers, some years ago, presented to the Peter Redpath Museum of McGill      University, a specimen of Ostrea which he had collected at Beauport, Québec and which he      believed had been derived from the Pleistocene of that locality." Ardley, himself "...      collected Pleistocene fossils from the Leda clay and Saxicava sand, exposed in an excavation      made for a drain in the town of</alinea><alinea>DeLormier, near Montréal, found at a depth of      9 feet below the surface... specimens of Ostrea were associated with Mya truncata, Macoma      calcarea, Astarte laurentiana, and Saxicava rugosa." The latter is an archaic term for      Hiatella arctica.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Wagner (1970), recorded from the Champlain Sea      the following species of molluscs that now have a Virginian range:</alinea><alinea>Neptunea      despecta tornata occurs at Wagner's localities 145,</alinea><alinea>159, 205, 223, and 229,      including GSC hypotype specimen</alinea><alinea>20140 from Grande Rivière du Chêne, Québec.      It ranges north to Gulf St. Lawrence today, south to Cape Cod.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Crassostrea virginica occurs at Wagner's localities 134 and 145.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) hypotype 20150, found at</alinea><alinea>Montréal      at 171 feet. It now ranges north to Baie des Chaleurs,</alinea><alinea>Gulf of St. Lawrence.      Wagner (1970, p. 38) remarked: "The actual</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Manuscrit reçu le 28      juin 1999 ; manuscrit révisé accepté le 16 septembre 1999 * Geological Survey of Canada      Contribution n° 1999151 ** E-mail address: adyke@nrcan.gc.ca</alinea><alinea/><alinea>-----------------------------------------------</alinea><alinea>124 A. S. DYKE and R.      N. McNEELY</alinea><alinea>Géographie physique et Quaternaire, 54(1), 2000</alinea><alinea>presence of C. virginica as a fossil in the Champlain Sea is open to some doubt. Some      occurrences observed have been of shells on or near the surface of the ground, which      undoubtedly date from modern times. This is probably the case with the specimen from locality      134; it was found in the soil layer. The Crassostrea collected from locality 145 (not      collected by the writer) unfortunately was not accompanied by stratigraphic data." Locality      145 was collected by V.K. Prest (see below). The same collection also contained Neptunea      despecta tornata, identified by Wagner.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Mysella planulata occurs at      Wagner's locality 225 and is GSC hypotype 20155 from Ancienne Lorette, Québec, 197 feet      asl.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Today it ranges from Prince Edward Island to Texas in shallow      water attached to wharf pilings and eel grass.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Lyonsia hyalina      occurs in Wagner's locality 223; GSC hypotype</alinea><alinea>20166, east bank of Grande      Rivière du Chêne, Québec, 330 feet asl. Today it ranges from Texas to southwestern Gulf of      St.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Lawrence.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Haminoea solitaria occurs      at Wagner's locality 77; GSC hypo- type 20141, Kenyon Township, Glengary County, Ontario, 295      feet asl. It ranges from Georgia to Gulf of St. Lawrence.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Yoldia      limatula occurs at Wagner's localities 206 and 220. It ranges from New Jersey to Gulf of St.      Lawrence.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Prest and Hode-Keyser (1977, p. 20) stated "The common      oyster, Crassostrea virginica, a very rare species in the</alinea><alinea>Champlain Sea, was      found in place at only two sites, both on the northwest side of Mont Royal: one at elevation      310 feet (93 m) on Côte-Sainte-Catherine Road west of Decelles</alinea><alinea>Avenue, and      the other (in clay) at elevation 171 feet (51.3 m) on Westbury Avenue near Mackenzie Street."      The latter is the specimen from Wagner's locality 145.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>In response      to Wagner's comment about the lack of strati- graphic data regarding the oyster collected at      site 145, Prest appended a handwritten note to his copy of Wagner's publication. This note      describes the following stratigraphic sequence, which was exposed in an excavation for a      building: 0-1 foot - very black soil, slightly sandy; 1-2 feet - grey</alinea><alinea>"B"      [soil] zone, calcareous sand; 2-3 feet - clayey sand; 3-</alinea><alinea>3.5 feet - clay with      shells; real coquina in places; both grey and red clay bands; 90-95 % of the shells are      Macoma; also</alinea><alinea>Mytilus, Saxicava rugosa [= Hiatella arctica] and      barnacles.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Wagner listed the Macoma as M. balthica and the      following additional shells at this site: Neptunea despecta tornata (see above), Portlandia      arctica, Mya arenaria, Mya truncata.</alinea><alinea/><alinea/><alinea>NEW      IDENTIFICATIONS</alinea><alinea>AND RADIOCARBON DATES</alinea><alinea>We attempted to find      the specimens of thermophilous molluscs listed above in collections of the Redpath Museum and      the Geological Survey of Canada. Unfortunately, the collections of Mr. Paisley from Baie des      Chaleurs and of Mr.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Ardley from DeLormier, both evidently collected      well below the surface, were not found. However, we obtained the following specimens and new      identifications, where noted, by</alinea><alinea>Dr. André Martel, a malacologist at the      Canadian Museum of</alinea><alinea>Nature (unpublished report to GSC dated      96-02-15):</alinea><alinea>1. A large shell fragment identified by Wagner as Yoldia limatula      (GSC locality 27310) included the hinge area and dentition. This shell was identified by      Martel as Yoldia hyperborea hyperborea, based on the characters found on the condrophore and      the muscle insertion scar. This animal has an arctic-subarctic distribution, ranging south      to</alinea><alinea>Newfoundland today. The specimen was returned undated to the GSC      collection. Note that Dawson (above) left open the possibility that the Yoldia limatula      identified by him was actually an arctic-subarctic species.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>2.      Redpath Museum collection 6638 contained shells listed as Yoldia limatula, enclosed in      hardened clay from</alinea><alinea>Rivière-du-Loup, possibly Dawson's sample. We soaked the      bulk sample in water to soften the clay and remove the shells to verify their identifications.      These were identified by Martel as Y. hyperborea hyperborea based on the condrophore and      muscle scar characteristics. The clay also contained Nuculana pernula (Arctic to Cape Cod),      Nucula tenuis (Labrador and Greenland to Florida), and Portlandia arctica.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>3. An unnumbered sample from Redpath museum collected at Mile End Quarries, Montréal,      contained shells of</alinea><alinea>Neptunea despecta. These were identified by Martel as N.      despecta despecta, which ranges from Greenland to</alinea><alinea>Maine.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>4. The oyster from Wagner's site 145 is represented by a single whole valve housed in      the GSC Paleontology Type</alinea><alinea>Collection as hypotype 20150, the type of Champlain      Sea oysters. We were permitted to cut a 267 mg piece from the ventral margin of this shell.      Its age was determined by</alinea><alinea>AMS dating to be 520 ± 50 years (TO-5626,      normalized to [.delta]13CPDB = -25 ‰). Clearly this is not an authentic member of the      Champlain Sea fauna. Reasonably, it was introduced to the marine sediment from which Prest      collected it by the excavation activity then in progress. If we apply the conventional marine      reservoir correction of 400 years, then this oyster was harvested and brought to Montréal, in      all likelihood to be used as food, about 120 years before</alinea><alinea>Prest's 1952 AD      collection. The original place and year of collection (harvest) and local marine reservoir age      are thus unknown. Therefore, the age determination merely provides an upper limit on a      reservoir age and the shell could have arrived in Montréal any time during the century or so      before AD 1952. However, if we assume that the shell was discarded just before excavation and      that the oysters came from the nearest commercial supplies in the western Gulf of St.      Lawrence, which is reasonable given 1950s transportation facilities, the apparent age of the      shell at time of its harvesting (say 1950) was 520 years minus the correction for industrial      carbon buildup to that date (given as 80 years by Mangerud and Gulliksen,</alinea><alinea>1975). This amounts to 440 years and is a reasonable result.</alinea><alinea/><alinea>5. The oyster shell collected by E.T. Chalmers from</alinea><alinea>Beauport, Québec      some years before 1912 AD is Redpath</alinea><alinea>Museum specimen RM-2.1802. We removed a      392 mg piece from the ventral edge and its age was determined to be 780 ± 50 years (TO-5702,      normalized to[.delta]13CPDB = - 25 ‰). Again this specimen clearly was not derived from the      Champlain Sea sediments, although it appeared to have been to the collector. If this oyster      was harvested</alinea><alinea/><alinea>-----------------------------------------------</alinea><alinea>THE TARDY, TASTY AND      CHILLY THERMOPHILES OF THE CHAMPLAIN SEA 125</alinea><alinea>Géographie physique et      Quaternaire, 54(1), 2000</alinea><alinea>in 1910 AD, the latest possible date according to      the description, the industrial carbon effect was then about 15 years in the upper ocean      (Mangerud and Gulliksen, 1975).</alinea><alinea/><alinea>Assuming this date, it was taken      from water with a reservoir age of 725 years (780-(1950-1910)-15). However, because the oyster      could have been harvested many years earlier, this is a maximum estimate of the reservoir age      at the harvesting site, likely somewhere in the western</alinea><alinea>Gulf of St.      Lawrence.</alinea><alinea/><alinea/><alinea>CONCLUSION</alinea><alinea/><alinea>We      attempted to test the authenticity of the rare finds of warm-water mollusc shells from the      Champlain Sea by reidentification and by radiocarbon dating of material in two paleontological      collections. Although not all specimens were found, shells previously identified as Yoldia      limatula (warm) are instead Y. hyperborea hyperborea (cold), and at least some</alinea><alinea>Neptunea despecta shells are assignable to the subspecies despecta (cold) rather than      tornata (warm). Two oyster shells thought to have come from Pleistocene beds date instead from      the historic period. They probably represent oysters brought in as food. Although we have not      tested all reported occurrences of Virginian taxa from Champlain Sea sediments, these reports      should be treated cautiously until they are confirmed by both identification and age      determinations.</alinea><alinea/><alinea/><alinea>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</alinea><alinea/><alinea>We appreciate the assistance an co-operation of Sandy</alinea><alinea>McCracken and      Jean Dougherty of GSC Paleontology Collections and of Ingrid Birker of Redpath Museum, McGill      University, in providing samples for study and dating.

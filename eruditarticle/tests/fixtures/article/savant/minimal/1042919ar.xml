        <alinea>In the late 20th century theorists within the radical feminist tradition such as Haraway (1988) highlighted the impossibility of separating knowledge from knowers, grounding firmly the idea that embodied bias can and does make its way into argument. Along a similar vein, Moulton (1983) exposed a gendered theme within critical thinking that casts the feminine as toxic ‘unreason’ and the ideal knower as distinctly masculine; framing critical thinking as a method of masculine knowers fighting off feminine ‘unreason’. Theorists such as Burrow (2010) have picked up upon this tradition, exploring the ways in which this theme of overly masculine, or ‘adversarial’, argumentation is both unnecessary and serves as an ineffective base for obtaining truth. Rooney (2010) further highlighted how this unnecessarily gendered context results in argumentative double binds for women, undermining their authority and stifling much-needed diversity within philosophy as a discipline. These are damning charges that warrant a response within critical thinking frameworks. We suggest that the broader critical thinking literature, primarily that found within contexts of critical pedagogy and dispositional schools, can and should be harnessed within the critical thinking literature to bridge the gap between classical and feminist thinkers. We highlight several methods by which philosophy can retain the functionality of critical thinking while mitigating the obstacles presented by feminist critics and highlight how the adoption of such methods not only improves critical thinking, but is also beneficial to philosophy, philosophers and feminists alike.</alinea>

Abstract: Philosophers often seek
the truth through methods taught
under the banner &quot;Critical thinking&quot;.
For most, some variation on this
method is used to organize thoughts
and filter away subjectivity and bi-
ases. Feminist philosophers have
highlighted a critical set of short-
comings within such methods that
are yet to be fully addressed. In this
paper, we explore these critiques
and how they can be mitigated by
incorporating elements from critical
pedagogy and dispositional thinkers.
The result is a set of recommenda-
tions for improved critical thinking
methods which better account for
contextualized bias while also more
accurately tracking the truth.

1. Context and definitional clarity
Philosophy as a discipline preoccupies itself chiefly with the
search for truth. As such, philosophers have spent a great deal of
time attempting to craft models and frameworks for reliably
finding the truth. Philosophers are not the only players in this
game however, and educational theorists, feminists and others
all seek to contribute on what makes a given pattern or method
of thinking “critical”. Each of these different schools aims at
something different, such as social change or challenging gen-
dered assumptions within language. This paper seeks to explore
that classic philosophical question of searching for the truth. As
such, for the purposes of this paper, critical thinking (CT) refers
to a method or intellectual behaviours designed to maximise
truth-seeking potential. We realize that defining CT can be quite
controversial, and we certainly don’t plan on addressing that
debate within this paper, but we hope that by taking this familiar
conception we can highlight for those within philosophy the im-
portance of thinking carefully about what competing concep-
tions have to offer within the search for truth.
Most philosophers to this day defend the idea that their work
is to some extent objective and not tainted too heavily by sub-
jective experiences or bias. Methods are employed, often taught
under the banner of CT, to filter out bias and subjectivity and
track truth. These methods predominantly contain some combi-
nation of formal and informal logic as well as training on com-
mon psychological biases and domain knowledge 1 . The claim
that such methods are objective, however, came under harsh
scrutiny in the 1900s, first by postmodern thinkers and later by
feminist scholars (Haraway, 1988; Moulton, 1983). While de-
1
Such methods also vary considerably depending on who teaches them, but a
common thread is the use of formal and informal logic as well as other
properties said to be truth tracking (Johnson &amp; Blair, 2009).

fenders of CT engaged vehemently with post-modern critiques,
the arguments made by feminist scholars have yet to be properly
engaged with, despite the spawning of an entire school of femi-
nist philosophy dedicated to highlighting and suggesting reme-
dies to these ills (Rooney &amp; Hundleby, 2010). Here’s our mod-
est attempt to address this situation, by exploring how current
CT methods can mitigate the challenge posed by feminist phi-
losophers and, in the process, improve current CT practice to
more accurately track the truth.
2. Feminist critiques
At the heart of feminist critiques of CT lies feminist epistemol-
ogy, more specifically standpoint theory (Anderson, 2015).
Standpoint theory refers to the idea that what a knower per-
ceives is influenced by their context, often their social and polit-
ical background (Harding, 1986). One proponent of standpoint
theory is Haraway (1988), who argues that “feminist objectivity
means quite simply situated knowledges” (p. 581). In essence,
Haraway argues that knowledge cannot be separated from the
knower and as a result the context surrounding a knower shapes
their knowledge intrinsically. In the case of gender, this might
mean that people are socially, perhaps even biologically, in-
clined toward particular favorings. For example, men in New
Zealand might be socialized toward stoic behaviours and shun
charity as a sign of weakness. This might lead masculine know-
ers 2 to assess an argument regarding, say, individualist policies
more favourably than one which argues along collectivist or
community-based grounds. In this case, the knowledge generat-
2
We use &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; as opposed to &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;
notions of reasons to isolate gender performance, which we do not equate
with biological sex. We choose this more appropriate terminology in re-
sponse to contemporary feminist, gender and queer theory, which came later
than some of the research we address in this paper.

ed through the use of any framework, including CT, will be
shaped by the knower themselves; meaning that their prior
knowledge will shape their acceptance of new knowledge.
This line of argument can lead to the promoting of a position
of absolute subjectivity or relativism. But Haraway is not con-
vinced relativism is any better than objectivism: “relativism is a
way of being nowhere while claiming to be everywhere equal-
ly” (p. 584). This is in reference to her claim that proponents of
CT’s objectivity commit to an impossible “gaze from nowhere”
(p. 581); with knowers separated from knowledge, nowhere, and
impartially “gazing” at truth without being embodied and pre-
sent 3 . In response to this problem Haraway argues for what she
calls “situated knowledges”. Her view is that we ought to accept
that knowledge is limited by people’s “situatedness” and as such
we should seek a diverse set of knowers to get a clearer picture
of the truth. It is not that there is no objective truth, as one might
be tempted to claim, but merely that the truth cannot be com-
pletely and singularly objective. Haraway describes this as the
“slippery pole” with relativists at one end and objectivists on the
other and argues we are best served by remaining in the middle;
acknowledging our knowledge as imperfect and situated and
working together to promote a more situated semi-objective un-
derstanding.
Within her argument for situated knowledges Haraway
(1988) takes aim at the classical claim of the sciences and phi-
losophy as bastions of objectivity. She argues, having estab-
lished that knowledge cannot be sufficiently separated from
knowers, that scientists and philosophers commit a “God trick”
(p. 582). This amounts to claiming a perfect separation of the
body and mind, knowledge and knower and contributes to an
3
This view shares much ground with Nagel’s (1986) book The View from
Nowhere .

“ideology of direct, devouring, generative and unrestricted vi-
sion” (p. 582); something that is clearly impossible if we accept
her previous arguments. This charge certainly seems apt for
parts of philosophy. With the clear goal of CT methods being
the separation of arguers from their embodied limitations, such
as confusion, bias or emotion, and committing fully to the task
of obtaining truth. This presents a problem for many schools of
philosophy, as CT methods form the bedrock of how philoso-
phers generate and test new knowledge and, much like psycho-
logical bias, the introduction of distorting experiences can sig-
nificantly impact on the truth tracking potential of any model.
Not all feminist scholars take the middle line position that
Haraway (1988) does, however, and more postmodern leaning
feminists take arguments such as hers as proof of the subjectivi-
ty of knowledge and the impossibility of an objective CT
framework. They argue for the dethroning of CT methods as the
best method for knowledge generation or decision making over
intuition or emotion (Mouffe, 2000; Thayer-Bacon, 1998). This
view is rooted in the charge that our culture has been built up on
the privileging of distinctly masculine styles of thought at the
expense of more traditionally feminine styles such as intuition
or emotion (Thayer-Bacon, 1998). Such scholars draw upon the
growing literature which suggests we use unconscious intuition
and emotional responses far more than we realize, contrasting
starkly with the calm, well thought out picture we have of our-
selves as critical thinkers (Kahneman, 2011). As a result, post-
modern feminists often argue that we ought to pay more atten-
tion to intuitional and emotional styles of thinking and remove
our focus from, and perhaps even be cautious of, the more phil-
osophical CT style of thinking.
Another important critique of CT is that it perpetuates a sex-
ist narrative and privileges masculine styles of reason over oth-
ers. The original account of this argument is credited to Moulton
but its contemporary form is highlighted well by Rooney
(2010). Rooney argues that philosophy perpetuates a narrative
© Adam Dalgleish, Patrick Girard &amp; Maree J. Davies. Informal Logic, Vol.
37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.356 Dalgleish, Girard &amp; Davies
of “embattled reason” (Moulton, 1983) 4 . The first part of the
picture Rooney highlights is philosophy’s adversarial nature,
namely that philosophy, as it is practiced within the literature,
very often takes up a metaphor of “arguments as war”: thinkers
pit ideas to the death and the best ideas remain. Further, she ar-
gues that the goal of argumentation under this narrative shifts to
the utter destruction of opposing argument, to “win” an argu-
ment, rather than arriving at truth. That this style of argumenta-
tion is prevalent can be seen with the frequent use of terminolo-
gy such as ‘opponents’, ‘defending’ or ‘challenging arguments’
being common within philosophy (Duffin, 2006).
A second part of this picture Rooney highlights is that within
western culture men have historically been viewed as stoic, rea-
soned and strong and women emotional, fickle and distracting.
Rooney argues this sexist attitude permeates this narrative; pro-
moting the myth of the “man of reason” who fights off feminine
unreason. Together, these two trends construct “embattled rea-
son” as a deeply flawed tool rooted in historical sexism and,
other feminists would argue, privileges strict, classical reason
over more feminine tools of reason; such as intuition, creativity
or emotion.
Rooney’s (2010) argument gains significant strength when
combined with Haraway’s (1988). If CT methods are not a neu-
tral and objective tool for generating knowledge, then the
flawed narrative of embattled reason seems even more problem-
atic; as its masculine centric narrative can be considered a part
of the reason philosophy attracts and maintains such a drastical-
ly low number of female philosophers. If knowledge cannot be
sufficiently separated from knowers, and our emotions, sociali-
zation and history taint our CT, then the stifling of diversity is
4
Lloyd (1984) also goes into much depth on this topic in his book The Man
of Reason .

37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.Critical Thinking, Bias &amp; Feminist Philosophy
357
actively limiting and hurting the pursuit of knowledge within
the discipline as well as maintaining a narrative harmful to
women more generally. Given this argument, one could easily
further argue that philosophy would benefit from a move away
from the traditional school of logic; or at least drastically reform
our attitudes toward its position as the prime method of reason.
Rooney does not go this far and identifies two key problems
with this line of argument. First, such an argument comes dan-
gerously close to committing to a narrative of gender difference,
advocating a position of masculine and feminine reason many
feminists would find distasteful—or worse in terms of male and
female reason. Second, this argument fails to account for the
rise of women within similarly masculine themed fields such as
Law; where women now comprise roughly 50% of admissions.
Surely if the masculine theme of philosophy was the main deter-
rent then the cutthroat and aggressive world of law would be
equally off-putting. Rooney does, however, argue that the com-
bative theme of philosophy is entirely unnecessary and argues
its prominence is informed by a strong narrative of historic male
preference and misogyny. Finally, she argues that philosophy
should work hard to take on board feminist critique of its can-
non and actively work toward un-entangling itself from the
“embattled reason” narrative.
A third critique, as examined by Burrow (2010), focuses on
arguers and how gender roles place women in argumentative
double binds, where women are expected to be adversarial, but
their authority is undermined for doing so. Burrow argues that
the adversarial context of modern philosophy attempts to force
women into argumentative contexts which are aggressive. Ag-
gressive, combative and direct communication has historically
been considered masculine in western culture and, as such, for
women to behave this way is to undermine their femininity and
thus their authority. Feminists have been highlighting for dec-
ades the negative perceptions that accompany stepping outside
one’s prescribed gender role and it is a claim that seems to be

37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.358 Dalgleish, Girard &amp; Davies
seldom contested within the literature. This argument adds fur-
ther heat to Rooney’s critique of adversarial argumentation but
also highlights a slight problem: rationality has been historically
considered masculine. While not as strongly coded as aggres-
sion or direct action, rationality has been considered for most of
history the realm of men. This is not to be confused with essen-
tialist claims that rationality is masculine; but merely that it has
been socially tied to that particular identity. If the other mascu-
line traits of argumentation undermine women’s authority then
surely rationality must too. But, rationality has not been consid-
ered the singular domain of men for decades now and as such it
seems unlikely that rationality would be a trait which would un-
dermine femininity. This is raised as a defender of the adversar-
ial context, someone who sees it as productive, might argue that
it is the gender roles that need abolishing, not the context. But
Burrow’s argument is not the only one levelled against the aver-
sarial context of philosophy and, as Rooney highlights, there
does not seem to be a reason for philosophy to be so adversarial
and more than a few concerns over it being so (Rooney, 2010).
While the identification of gender-based problems within ad-
versarial argumentation could be disregarded as dealing with a
symptom of gender roles rather than the cause, these critiques
do seem to raise important points. First, if philosophy as a disci-
pline could introduce more diversity within its ranks by adopt-
ing a less adversarial tone, then surely this is worth pursuing.
Second, as was pointed out by Rooney, adversarial argumenta-
tion has negative effects on the quality and conduct of argu-
ment. shifting, or sometimes conflating, “winning” an argument
with “seeking truth” (Rooney, 2010). Historically philosophy
has been very resistant toward these kinds of arguments, despite
their quite reasonable critiques of the discipline and the irony of
critiquing the core CT method used by philosophers for not be-
ing receptive to critiques—a trait many would argue is core to
good CT. If philosophy is to claim to be the home of the search
© Adam Dalgleish, Patrick Girard &amp; Maree J. Davies. Informal Logic, Vol.
37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.Critical Thinking, Bias &amp; Feminist Philosophy
359
for truth, then philosophers need to be receptive to critiques that
their methods are being distorted by situated biases.
3. Broader critical thinking literature: What can we learn?
As mentioned earlier, philosophy is not the only discipline that
has grappled with the topic of CT. Educational theorists in par-
ticular have put great effort into attempting to distil the essence
of CT so that it can be taught as a public good. One of the first
theorists to spark this trend was Dewey, who conceptualized CT
as the “active, persistent and careful consideration of any belief
or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that
support it, and the further conclusions to which it tends...”
(Dewey, 1910, p .6). At this stage, educational CT methods
shared many traits with philosophical CT and was focused pri-
marily on argumentative methods upon which a user could pro-
gress toward reliable and true beliefs. But, as time progressed,
educational theorists began highlighting a second important trait
they called “critical dispositions”. As Facione (2015) highlights,
being a good critical thinker means more than the use of a par-
ticular method and can be seen to be as much a set of traits as it
is a set of skills. He argues that good CT requires thinkers who
are open to new ideas, constantly challenging their beliefs, dili-
gent in seeking out new knowledge and honest when confront-
ing opposing argument. Critical thinkers might be operating
within a philosophical CT framework and yet be unwilling to
apply it consistently. Such thinkers could critique arguments
they don’t like while defending ones they do and as such pro-
duce biased results far from the truth philosophy strives for.
While not a perfect mix, this critique can be seen to share much
with the argument proposed by Rooney, arguing that adversarial
argumentation can undermine the quest for truth in favour of a
more combative joust of ideas. Overall, dispositional CT high-
lights the traits required to be a good critical thinker and empha-
sises that they should be considered a key part of the CT picture.

Another vein within educational pursuits of CT literature is
critical pedagogy, which argues that being critical is to be aware
of societal structures and bias, and how these impact the way we
think about and view the world. The critical pedagogy school’s
ideology is tied up intrinsically with critical theory and anti-
conservative politics, with theorists such as Freire (1970) and
hooks (1994) viewing the educational system as a dogmatic en-
gine of conservative worldviews. To these theorists, the CT
method should be viewed as a way of thinking that encourages
students to challenge dominant narratives and enables them to
explore their place within societal power structures. “Powerful
knowledge”, to use Young’s (2009) term, is knowledge with
epistemic and specialised properties whose purpose is to assist
students to think about the world in abstract or context-
independent ways. This type of knowledge provides students
with the ability to develop a critical awareness of the forces
structuring their lives and to imagine alternatives beyond their
everyday experiences (Young, 2009). Pedagogy that addresses
these wider social issues is argued by some as critical pedagogy
(McLaren, Macrine, &amp; Hill, 2010). These researchers argue that,
if schools are serious about allowing students to understand is-
sues about power in society, the micropolitical everyday lives of
teachers and students should address the wider and larger eco-
nomic, cultural, social and institutional structures through such
avenues as discourse in classrooms. Critical pedagogy sought to
change the way schools taught, decentralizing power and de-
mocratising thought as a method for overcoming the strangle-
hold conservative forces gain through controlling education. In
this way they share roots with dispositional thinkers such as
Dewey (1910), but also marry his ideas with critical theorists
such as Foucault and Bourdieu (Bourdieu, 1974; Foucault,
1982). As such, good critical thinkers within the critical peda-
gogy are aware of and equipped to tackle biases and power im-
balances within the system as a means to mitigate their broader
effect on society. In short, thinkers rooted in the critical peda-

gogy school are made highly aware of how their context shapes
their perception and this allows them to challenge assumptions
more readily than is possible by focusing merely on premises,
argument structure and willingness to engage honestly in argu-
ment. This way of thinking clearly shares roots with Haraway’s
(1988) argument for situated knowledges and provides a broader
literature base from which potential critical thinkers could draw
from to be more critical in this vein. Similarly, critical thinkers
from this school would also be far better equipped to address
some of the concerns surrounding Burrow’s argumentative dou-
ble bind argument, by being aware of social roles and societal
power and actively keeping that in mind as they deliberate. In
essence, critical pedagogy’s take on CT encompasses an aware-
ness of power contexts and the biases they produce; using this
knowledge as a method for fighting bias and oppression.
These two positions, dispositional and critical pedagogy, ex-
pose for us the kinds of traits that could be incorporated into an
improved CT method within philosophy. Put simply, current
philosophical CT methods lack context. In its base form, it re-
mains blind to arguers and the context those arguers reside with-
in. As our theorists have shown, arguers and contexts are critical
to the practice of good CT; a fact dispositional and critical ped-
agogy theorists have already internalized. But it does not stop
there, even within CT courses taught on the modern university
campus, dispositional traits and bias make their way into the
curriculum in small ways. The principle of charity, a core part
of many introductory texts, is a clear example of positive dispo-
sitional CT. Psychological biases are also often used to help
show how flawed our CT skills can be on their face and how we
need to be careful to avoid these common pitfalls. But if being
aware of psychological biases is considered acceptable, even
important, for the CT method used within philosophy then why
are societal or social biases not treated the same way? Given the
mountain of evidence coming from throughout the social and
cognitive sciences, that we are quite bad at filtering out personal

37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.362 Dalgleish, Girard &amp; Davies
biases, these broader contexts are more important than ever
(Kahneman, 2011). An important answer could be that such a
story is contradicting a deeply held desire within philosophy:
that we can separate ourselves from context and deeply ponder
to generate objective knowledge. But as we have seen from
feminist critics, and acknowledge already by attempting to miti-
gate psychological biases within our practice, our method is sel-
dom completely objective. While philosophers may like to think
we are objective, adopting an active process of exploring and
checking our biases may well be the most reliable and effective
path to maximizing objectivity and truth-tracking potential.
4. Feminist-friendly critical thinking
Following the critiques of feminist scholars and the clear in-
sights we can gain from the dispositional school and critical
pedagogy, CT would gain from responding to the clear debunk-
ing of the idea that CT is objective in practice. The most direct
and productive response is to combine and consider the litera-
ture on CT from other discipline—in the case of feminist cri-
tiques, critical pedagogy inspired by critical theory scholars. As
highlighted earlier, critical pedagogy, rather than focusing on
the practice of classical philosophical argument, seeks to high-
light social concepts such as privilege, social construction and
situated awareness. As critical pedagogy was designed with a
similar philosophy of situated awareness in mind, its inclusion
within a combined CT framework by definition mitigates Hara-
way’s concerns regarding the narrow application of knowledge
and promotes a more diverse set of knowers. This also ties in
nicely to addressing our later critiques as a more group-based
collaborative style of argumentation, that constructs rather than
attacks arguments, would be ideal within a critical pedagogy
framework. By adopting a more collaborative style, we could
address both the potential issues arising from “embattled rea-
son” as well as concerns over gender-based double binds for
women, limiting adversariality within a more feminist-friendly

37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.Critical Thinking, Bias &amp; Feminist Philosophy
363
context and reducing the requirement for women to be adversar-
ial to contribute their experiences and knowledge to discussions.
Overall, the introduction of a context of critical pedagogy into a
framework of CT, we suggest, could successfully mitigate the
critiques presented by feminist scholars.
To illustrate, consider if when we attempted to assess an ar-
gument we included within our CT method simply asking our-
selves, or co-operative others, how might our experiences be
impacting our assessment of this argument? What might other,
relevant groups disagree with and where do they sit within pow-
er structures? This may seem trivial, but reaching outside our
context even in this small way could have big impacts on our
arguments. For example, if we were to assess an argument about
the ethical content of a refugee policy without considering the
experiences of refugees within that policy, we are likely to miss
critical information relevant to our argument. A similar case
could be made for more dispositional styles of CT. Simply add-
ing a step to our model that includes searching other disciplines
for relevant critiques could add much value. The value of step-
ping outside one’s current literature into an adjacent one often
brings much depth into discussions. By doing the first, we in
part acknowledge the intuitional and emotional connection ar-
guers often have based on their experiences and by doing the
first and the second we expose ourselves to alternate interpreta-
tions which serve both a bias checking role and soften the tone
of discussions to be more open to ideas and less hostile. Overall,
small additions like these to the practice and teaching of CT
within philosophy would certainly result in more accurate truth
tracking as well as go some way toward addressing the concerns
of standpoint, critical pedagogy and dispositional theorists.
To really drive home the point, consider this: it is entirely
possible for a thinker to be “critical” in the sense that they are
using the current standard methods employed within philosophy
frameworks, and also be completely unaware of how their expe-
riences are shaping their intuitions toward an argument. It’s also
© Adam Dalgleish, Patrick Girard &amp; Maree J. Davies. Informal Logic, Vol.
37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.364 Dalgleish, Girard &amp; Davies
completely possible that such a thinker might be employing that
framework, considering their experiences but still applying that
knowledge in an uneven way. A combination of, at least, solid
philosophical logic training, a grounding in and tendency to-
ward considering the experiences of others and an honest and
consistent drive to apply such skills evenly is needed for robust
critical thinking 5 . Missing any one of these branches would
mean a thinker would less accurately track the truth in their ar-
guments and, under our definition, be less critical.
While some might think that CT and critical pedagogy are in
conflict, there seems little reason for them to be in reality. One
major concern that could be raised is how to treat well-reasoned
conservative arguments within this new CT method. In this
case, proponents of critical pedagogy have to acknowledge that
conservative arguments may be acceptable, upon scrutiny. Fur-
thermore, the raising of conservative arguments allows such
theorists ample opportunity to highlight the flaws in these posi-
tions, undermining their status as universal, societal truths and
bringing them down to the level of one view in a sea of
knowledge.
The meshing of a classic CT framework within a critical
pedagogy context could also address prominent concerns for
both disciplines. For philosophical CT, it helps mitigate our
concerns over CT and for proponents of critical pedagogy it
would provide a much-needed vehicle for the promotion of crit-
ical pedagogy ideas within schools, harnessing the groundswell
of enthusiasm for promoting CT as a force for social change.
Overall, not only could these two positions come together to
provide a more robust and well framed critical discourse, they
both benefit from collaboration.
5
Knowledge and avoidance of psychological biases might be another branch,
but as these are sometimes acknowledged within the philo-sophical CT
method as is.
© Adam Dalgleish, Patrick Girard &amp; Maree J. Davies. Informal Logic, Vol.
37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.Critical Thinking, Bias &amp; Feminist Philosophy
365
In practice, philosophy as a discipline has been quite incon-
sistent in addressing broader takes on CT. Practicing philoso-
phers often do not make or have trouble making use of the
broader modern CT literature. Blair highlights this well in his
article, where he argues that CT and logic should be considered,
and in reality are, separate entities which have often been con-
flated. This trend is also clear when we examine the perspective
of critical pedagogy, but can also be seen within the more close-
ly related dispositional school which promotes good conduct
amongst arguers (Blair, 2012) 6 . A core component of good CT
from within a dispositional framework is the willingness to
challenge your own views and reform them in the face of evi-
dence. But even prominent and esteemed philosophers have
trouble adhering to this quality at times (Thayer-Bacon, 1998).
In fact, the inclusion of critical pedagogy within philosophy
would go a long way toward addressing the lack of dispositional
CT found within the literature, since being forced to repeatedly
encounter alternative views will help open up the dialogue about
existing dominant narratives. There will be situations where
feminist or progressive ideas would be challenged within such a
CT framework, but the onus should fall on the pedagogy side to
explain why these arguments are incorrect rather than de facto
labelling them as uncritical, as some might be tempted to do.
A familiar issue that raises concern for this proposed revision
of the method is “the paradox of bias”. The paradox of bias is a
phenomenon described by feminist scholars where their cri-
tiques of privileged, biased systems is met with quite legitimate
criticism that their recommendations introduce feminist-based
bias (Anderson, 2015). Defenders of the classical system of CT
could object that the introduction of feminist charged philoso-
6
Johnson &amp; Blair’s (2009) helpful article was brought to our attention by a
reviewer and is an excellent overview of the kind of diversity that can be
found within CT methods .

37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.366 Dalgleish, Girard &amp; Davies
phy, such as that found within critical pedagogy, introduces po-
litical bias into the framework; disproportionately representing a
progressive, feminist set of values. But, the claim that feminist
revision introduces politically charged bias into the current
framework of CT assumes that the current framework is not al-
ready biased in practice, which is a premise that has been thor-
oughly debunked by feminist scholars. Further, the framework
even in theory could be seen as politically biased in some ways;
promoting an individualistic, conservative position that resists
change. In this context, the introduction of feminist bias is not
making this new framework any more biased; but rather intro-
ducing an ideological “check” which can help balance existing
bias within the current framework. It could also be argued that
feminist bias is preferable to our established bias as it promotes
a context of knowledge generation; prompting its users to think
deeper about their context. We must be careful however to bal-
ance the perspectives of this new feminist take and that of CT;
lest we merely replace an individualistic and conservative dom-
inated CT with a progressive, feminist dominated one instead.
Overall, examination of the paradox helps illuminate and rein-
force previous arguments surrounding why the introduction of
broader ideas into CT frameworks is necessary.
Lastly, the CT literature is large and we do not claim to have
contained within this article all the potential angles within
which CT practice could be improved. Similarly, we don’t claim
to have provided any sort of robust framework to guide the con-
struction of a new, more well-rounded CT framework. We have
instead merely indicated an area within which current philo-
sophical CT models lack and attempted to highlight the possible
fruits of collaboration between competing definitions across
disciplines. We think that the potential benefits of incorporating
critical pedagogy ideas within philosophical CT highlights the
importance of taking a step back and asking ourselves what it
means to think critically and may well provide a bridge between
feminist and philosophical thinkers. We hope that a union of
© Adam Dalgleish, Patrick Girard &amp; Maree J. Davies. Informal Logic, Vol.
37, No. 4 (2017), pp. 351-369.Critical Thinking, Bias &amp; Feminist Philosophy
367
ideas between these, and perhaps other, schools of thought can
foster more contextualized and robust styles of critical thought.
5. Summary and conclusion
As we have examined, Feminist theorists such as Haraway,
Rooney and Burrow have successfully exposed unquestioned
assumptions and highlighted practical limitations within the
philosophical practice of CT which cast serious doubt on its
ability to remain objective in the search for truth. We think the
critiques highlighted by these feminist theorists can and should
be addressed within philosophical critical thinking methods. As
a result, we have argued that incorporating elements from within
the discourse of critical pedagogy and dispositional veins of
critical thinking would create a more robust and effective CT
method. If philosophers are employing such methods as a means
to more accurately track the truth in their work, then we would
argue they have significant reason to consider reforming how
we think about, teach and practice “critical thinking” in philoso-
phy. For philosophers, this would mean a step away from their
roots and toward addressing more seriously and equally the per-
spectives of dispositional and critical pedagogy thinkers. For
feminist and critical pedagogy thinkers, incorporating their ideas
into the philosophical CT method could also provide useful out-
lets to elicit social change by harnessing enthusiasm for the
promotion of critical thinking toward progressive social aims.
Overall, the adoption of such methods can benefit both sides of
this debate; mitigating the bias present within the philosophical
practice of CT and providing feminist proponents with a legiti-
mate outlet with which to push toward social change. We think
this illustrates quite clearly the potential benefits of co-operation
between competing definitions of critical thinking and argue
that bridging the gap between these definitions is a topic worthy
of further consideration and analysis.
